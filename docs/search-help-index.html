                <h3>Indexes and Searching</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>In contrast to search in a word processing document, search in a database
                        goes through an index. Just as in the index of a book, terms are extracted
                        from the text and arranged in a list where each item is keyed to their
                        positions in the text. When searching a database, the search terms are
                        matched against the index and the parts of the text that contain the terms
                        are then displayed.</p>
                    <p>Sanskrit can be written in various acripts; in SARIT, Devanagari script and
                        IAST romanisation are used. To the database, the fact that different scripts
                        are used does not matter — they are treated in the same way, as Unicode
                        characters. However, no matter whether Devanagari or romanisation is used,
                        there are differences in the way texts are segmented, that is, how texts are
                        divided by the use of spaces (and other characters) into words. This is of
                        great importance when searching SARIT texts, for one kind of index suits
                        texts that are divided (more or less) into words and another kind suits
                        texts that (more or less) are written as one long string of characters. The
                        first of these, the word index, is the Lucene Full-Text index, and the
                        second, the string index, is the NGram index. Whereas the the Lucene
                        Full-Text index contains words, the NGram Index consists of overlapping
                        chunks of text three characters long (tri-grams).</p>
                    <p>Different kinds of indexes mean different search options. With a Lucene
                        Full-Text index, you can, e.g., search for contexts in which a number
                        of words are close to each other, regardless of their order, but with an
                        NGram index, this is not easily possible. With an NGram index, you can use
                        wildcards, but you basically search for what is there, that is, what you
                        input as your search term is what you will retrieve. The important thing to
                        note here is that if you use the NGram index, you will retrieve instances in
                        which your search string occurs inside a longer string in the text, whereas
                        if you use the Lucene Full-Text index (and do not use wildcards), you will
                        find only instances in the text that are identical to your search
                        string.</p>
                    <p>All texts are indexed in both ways and you choose which index to use. Since
                        not all texts divide the text into words, you should choose the index that
                        is most suited for your text. This is not done automatically.</p>
                    <p>All the texts are marked up according to the TEI Guidelines. A text marked up
                        in this way basically divides into a header describing the text edition and
                        the edition/text proper. The header, being written mostly in English, will
                        have standard word divisions, so here the Lucene Full-Text index and its
                        associated search options will be profitable to use, but the way word
                        division is implemented in the text proper differs from text to text.</p>
                    <p>However, though there are these differences, if you are looking simply for a
                        string match of a single search term, and do not mind if the string occurs
                        as part of a larger string, use the defaults and search using the NGram
                        index, optionally with the regex methods described in <a href="search-help-ngram">NGram Search</a>. This is easiest and very
                        fast. If the text is divided into words, use the Lucene Full-Text index
                        and its many options. Now, to complicate matters, the Lucene Full-Text
                        index has quite advanced regex options, described in <a href="search-help-lucene-regex">Lucene Regex Search</a>, and one could,
                        if one wished to do so, use these options instead of the NGram Index, but
                        the drawback here is that this would make searches quite slow and
                        resource-demanding. Choose your index wisely!</p>
                    <!--<p>(With the string index, you can search for two strings within a certain
                            range of characters, say 10-50, which can be useful, but generally
                            speaking, the word index is much more powerful, though precisely this,
                            it cannot do.)</p>-->
                    <p>Word division is a matter of degree. Among the SARIT texts, only the
                        Arthaśāstra can be said to be divided into words in a way which makes
                        the use of the Lucene Full-Text index immediately possible. For information
                        about the remaining texts, see <a href="search-help-word-division.html">Word Division</a>. With these texts, you should as a rule use the
                        NGram Index.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Search Targets</h5>
                    <p>A search is performed in a number of fields – to be more exact, in indexes
                        based on certain fields. This contrasts with searches in a word processing
                        document which are made in a document as a whole, as one long string of
                        characters or words.</p>
                    <p>However, the word "fields" is not adequate. If you search in a bibliography,
                        you might search for a term inside the title field or for an author in the
                        author field, but with texts it is different. Here you might have a name
                        occurring in the middle of a sentence, and this name is wrapped up a name
                        tag, like this &lt;name&gt;Kamalaśīla&lt;/name&gt;, so here the name "field"
                        occurs in the middle of some pure text. The correct word to use for this is
                        "element" – text is contained in elements, just as the text string
                        "Kamalaśīla" is enclosed in the "name" element.</p>
                    <p>Elements come in different kinds: one kind is used to represent the major
                        structural divisions of the text and another is used to wrap around e.g.
                        names inside text in the manner just described. The structural divisions of
                        a text forms a hierarchy, just as a book contains a number of chapters,
                        which contain a number of sections, which contain a number of paragraphs –
                        which then contain the actual text, with or without any inline elements.</p>
                    <p>SARIT texts are of different kinds, so the structural elements they use are
                        not completely the same. However, all texts divide into a number of
                        divisions, called "div"s. In the table of contents, the top three divs of
                        each text are displayed. Some texts have that number of structural levels,
                        some less and some more, but only three levels are displayed in order to
                        speed up display in the case of texts with very fine-grained structure. </p>
                    <p>This database theory is relevant to understanding what goes on when one
                        searches.</p>
                    <p> When you search for the co-occurrence of two words, say "svabhāva" and
                        "lakṣaṇa", you do not search in the text as a whole, but you get a hit only
                        if the two words occur in the same text-containing element. A
                        text-containing element might here be a paragraph or a line group. The
                        number of hits you get is not the number of times the search term(s) occur
                        in a text, but the number of search targets that contain the search term(s)
                        – it may well be that the same paragraph contains several instances of
                        "lakṣaṇa", but you only find the paragraph once.</p>
                    <p>The number of hits in a text is not the number of times the search term
                        occurs in the text as a whole – it is the number of times a search target in
                        the text (a paragraph or a div) contains one or more instances of the search
                        term, so if five paragraphs contain your search term, you will get five hits
                        when you search on paragraphs, but only one hit if you are searching on
                        sections and the five paragraphs are contained within one and the same
                        section. Note that each and every instance of the search term is displayed
                        in the hitlist – only the numbers of hits is affected by the search
                        context.</p>
                    <p>The search scope here described is the default "narrow" search scope. It
                        searches in the text-containing elements immediately below the structural
                        elements, that is, it searches in paragraphs and suchlike. If you choose,
                        you can search more broadly, in the divisions above these text-containing
                        elements. This means that you search in the lowest "div"s. If you do so, the
                        co-occurrence of two words can span several paragraphs and you may search
                        for words which are within, say, 10 words of each other, though they belong
                        to different paragraphs. Both kind of search scopes are useful for certain
                        tasks, so you should choose your search scope carefully!</p>
                    <p>In the index, no matter whether it is a Lucene Full-Text index or an NGram
                        index, index items are lower-cased. This means that there is no way to
                        differentiate between, say, "Hamlet" (the proper name) and "hamlet" (a
                        village), but it also means that you do not have to remember whether the
                        word you search for occurs first in a sentence and therefore is in
                        upper-case. The search terms you input are lower-cased, upper-casing search
                        strings has no effect.</p>
                    <p>With the Lucene Full-Text index you search for words — spaces and punctuation
                        and so on cannot be searched for, only the words themselves. All your input
                        is stripped of punctuation, so you can just as well spare yourself the
                        effort to input them – whether you search for "To be, or not to be" or "to
                        be or not to be" is all the same. </p>
                    <p>One may ask: if spaces cannot be searched for, what are phrase searches?
                        Don't phrases consist of words with spaces and punctuation in between? Yes,
                        but when you search for a phrase with the Lucene Full-Text index, this is
                        not the same as when you search for a phrase in a word processing document –
                        with Lucene, you actually search for a sequence of words which have no words
                        in between them, so everything is about words after all (and a phrase search
                        is actually a proximity search – more about that later).</p>
