            <h3>SARIT: Search and Retrieval of Indic Texts</h3>
            <!--<h3>Overview</h3>-->
            <p>Welcome to the SARIT website. Here you will find electronic editions of texts in
                Sanskrit and other Indian languages. These are documented, dated and have embedded
                notes about their change history, so that they can be publicly cited and used with
                confidence as scholarly sources. The editions in the SARIT library currently include
                    <a href="./..">these works</a>.</p>
            <p>This website also currently offers tools for text search, retrieval and analysis of
                the works in the SARIT library. You can search for words and phrases, and have your
                search results displayed as keywords-in-context. </p>
            <p>All the texts at SARIT are licensed under a&#160;Creative Commons license.&#160;You
                can download all the texts&#160;in the following formats: XML, EPUB and PDF; and you
                can also open the XML-file online.</p>

                <h4>History</h4>
                <p>The <a href="http://www.tlg.uci.edu/" target="_blank">Thesaurus Linguae
                        Graecae</a> was founded in 1972. Its subsequent growth as a sophisticated
                    research tool, and the projects derived from it, such as <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/" target="_blank">PERSEUS</a>,
                    demonstrated compellingly that a corpus of classical texts in machine-readable
                    format could be vitally important for the study of language, art, history and
                    culture. The history of SARIT looks back to a meeting convened by Prof. Richard
                    Lariviere at the University of Texas in 1988 that brought together many
                    specialists interested in creating a "TLG for Indic," i.e., a corpus of
                    machine-readable texts in Indian languages. The <a href="http://www.academia.edu/360194/Report_on_the_Sanskrit_Text_Archive_Conference_Austin_Texas_October_28-29_1988">minutes</a> of that meeting still make interesting reading today, and lay
                    out some of the rationales underlying the present project. After the Texas
                    meeting, the <a href="http://indology.info/" target="_blank">INDOLOGY
                        website</a> began to make electronic texts of Sanskrit works available in an
                    ad-hoc manner. This effort was highly successful, but there remained problems of
                    format normalization, non-standard fonts and character encodings. Many of these
                    problems were insoluble at the time. Things have moved forward since 1988,
                    especially in corpus linguistics, computer networking, and encoding standards.
                    SARIT takes advantage of all these new developments, especially <a href="http://www.unicode.org/">Unicode</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/" target="_blank">XML</a> and the <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/" target="_blank">Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)</a>.</p>

                <h4>What makes SARIT different?</h4>
                <p>The main difference between this collection of texts in Sanskrit and other Indian
                    languages is that these texts are marked up ("tagged") using the rich <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/">Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)</a> system. TEI
                    is a way of tagging files that was designed by humanities scholars for
                    humanities scholars. It is capable of building a great deal of intelligence into
                    the file itself, so that a TEI-file can later serve many purposes and remains
                    flexible and useful in the long term. TEI files contain their own history, so
                    you can always find out where the file came from, how and when it has been
                    updated, and how it relates to printed editions, manuscripts or other sources.
                    For a gentle introduction to the TEI, see the excellent <a href="http://www.teibyexample.org/">TEI by Example website</a>. The files in
                    this language corpus can be considered as electronic editions, and can be cited
                    as such in scholarly research publications. SARIT texts respect copyright and
                    are licensed appropriately to allow free academic use. Furthermore, SARIT makes
                    its TEI editions of Indian texts freely available to all.</p>
                <p>Electronic texts are not static: we edit them, improve them, alter them, and –
                    crucially – correct errors in them. SARIT solves the problem of how to manage
                    the natural evolution of electronic texts, documenting changes and allowing for
                    the divergence and comparison of versions, merging of versions and rolling-back
                    to previous versions. SARIT achieves this through the use of sophisticated
                    version-control software (see the technical section below). </p>
                <!--NB! Works with "." Does not work with "?+*|{}[]()\" Single |()[] are removed from search term.-->
                <!--<p>Additionally, any characters (except double quotes) are interpreted literally when surrounded by double quotes:</p> <pre class="literallayout">"john.smith.com"</pre>. NB: only works if shifting to phrase search. Partial phrase searches (john"@smith.com") are not possible-->

                <h4>Technical description</h4>
                <p>SARIT displays Indological texts marked up according to the <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/">Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)</a> guidelines.
                    The standardized TEI format used for encoding the files in the SARIT library
                    means that other interfaces and toolsets are possible and may be implemented in
                    future.</p>
                <p>SARIT uses the Open Source XML database <a href="http://exist-db.org/" target="_blank">eXist-db</a> for search and display. The SARIT application
                    has been developed by the <a href="http://www.asia-europe.uni-heidelberg.de/en/hra-portal.html">HRA</a>
                    (Jens Østergaard Petersen) at the <a href="http://www.asia-europe.uni-heidelberg.de/">Cluster of Excellence "Asia
                        and Europe in a Global Context"</a> (University of Heidelberg) in
                    collaboration with <a href="http://existsolutions.com/" target="_blank">eXist
                        Solutions GmbH</a>.</p>

                <h4>Get involved!</h4>
                <p>The master copies of the SARIT e-texts are maintained at <a href="https://github.com/sarit/SARIT-corpus">GitHub</a>, where a complete
                    history of all edits to the files is tracked. If you wish to report errors or
                    suggestions about the content of the SARIT text editions, for example errors in
                    transcription or encoding, please go to the <a href="https://github.com/sarit/SARIT-corpus/issues">Issues</a> page and report
                    in as much detail as you can. Experienced Git users are encouraged to
                    participate in maintaining the files themselves through the Github system.</p>

                    financial support from <a href="http://www.basas.org.uk/" target="_blank">The
                        British Association for South Asian Studies</a> (that enabled Richard
                    Mahoney to develop the site and add texts).</p>
                <p>SARIT received major funding from the <a href="http://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/236347141">NEH/DFG Bilateral
