        <h3>Encoding Guidelines</h3>
        <p>This document presents guidelines for the creation of digital texts in Sanskrit, Prakrit,
            and other Indian languages.</p>
        <p>These guidelines are maintained by SARIT (<a class="external" href="http://sarit.indology.info">http://sarit.indology.info</a>). SARIT maintains a
        collection of digital texts that conform to the standards of the Text Encoding Initiative
        (TEI) and provides tools for browsing and seaching these texts. These guidelines have two
        main purposes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>to document the standards that the SARIT project has followed in the creation of its
                own digital texts;</li>
            <li>to provide guidance for how to apply the TEI standards to texts in Sanskrit and
                other Indian languages;</li>
            <li>to promote the production of TEI-conformant digital texts in the community of Indian
                studies.</li>
        </ol>
         <p>The guidelines come in two varieties: <strong>simple</strong> and
            <strong>full</strong>.</p> <ul>
            <li>The <em>simple</em> guidelines (this document) document the minimal level of
                encoding that SARIT requires of texts in its collections. These guidelines provide a
                straightforward path “from printed edition to digital text,” and should suffice for
                the purposes of most projects.</li>
            <li>The <em>full</em> guidelines supplement the simple guidelines. The TEI standards
                that SARIT follows allow for encoding features of a text that aren’t typically
                included in “plain” digital texts. The full guidelines provide guidance for these
                advanced features. If you want your digital text to reflect textual variation (in
                the form of a critical apparatus or otherwise), cross-references within the text or
                references to other texts, or any kind of controlled vocabulary (persons, works,
                places, etc.), then the <em>full</em> guidelines are for you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Texts that are encoded according to the simple guidelines can always be “enhanced” at a
            later stage with the markup described in the full guidelines.</p>

        <p>Digital texts come in a variety of formats, but the texts distributed by SARIT are XML
            files that conform to standards of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI).</p>
        <a name="What-is-XML"/>
        <h4>What is XML?<a href="#What-is-XML" class="wiki-anchor"/>
        </h4>
        <p>In the days of publishing before word-processing, copy editors used to "mark up" an
            author's typed or handwritten manuscript for the printer, using written abbreviations to
            indicate structural points in the text, like headings, indents or font changes. XML is
            simply a collection of markup conventions for digital documents. Most web pages use XML
            or an XML-like form of markup. HTML is a special case of XML. The key feature of XML is
            its use of <strong>elements</strong>, which start and end with tags in angle-brackets,
            and signal some <em>editorial</em> intention relating to the text: </p>
            <pre>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
            <p>Elements can be nested within
            each other:</p>
            <pre>&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;hi&gt;highlighted text&lt;/hi&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
            <p>Elements
            can also be given <strong>attributes</strong>:</p>
            <pre>&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;hi rend="bold"&gt;an element&lt;/hi&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
            <p>In
            a <strong>well-formed</strong> XML document, every starting tag corresponds to an ending
            tag, and vice versa, and all of the elements are arranged hierarchically and without
            overlapping. But in order to be useful, the document must use elements in a well-defined
            and standardized way. A document that formally defines what elements may be used in an
            XML document, and how they may be used, is called a <strong>schema</strong>.</p>
        <p>Once you have well-formed and valid XML, what can you do with it? There are many computer
            programs that can read an XML text and do all sorts of interesting things. One of the
            first things you may want to do is to check that the file you have painstakingly
            prepared really is well-formed. That is the work of a so-called "XML Parser." It can
            check your text and flag up inconsistencies in the markup, making sure that it validates
            against a schema. But that is only the beginning.</p>
        <p>Since XML provides a structure that computers can easily navigate, it is easy to find any
            part of a document. You can index these parts in a database for searching, or you can
            transform them into a format that human beings can read: HTML, RTF, or PDF. XML texts
            can be converted into almost any other format, or processed in many complicated ways
            using a super-strength version of search-and-replace called XSLT.</p>

        <h5>How do I type XML texts?<a href="#How-do-I-type-XML-texts" class="wiki-anchor"/>
        </h5>
        <p>An XML document has no hidden codes, and can be typed with <em>any</em> writing program
            from the simplest editor to the most feature-rich word processor. Many modern programs
            have XML "modes" that provide things like syntax-highlighting or online help; others
            have been created specifically for typing XML. Several of these programs have XML
            Parsers built in to them, so that they can check your input as you go along and perhaps
            even format it nicely on the screen.</p>
        <a name="What-is-TEI"/>
        <h5>What is TEI?<a href="#What-is-TEI" class="wiki-anchor"/>
        </h5>
        <p>The Text Encoding Initiative produces guidelines for encoding texts as XML documents and
            schemas for validating those documents. The TEI guidelines have been used, and continue
            to be used, in hundreds of text-encoding projects, and form the basis of many other
            subprojects (such as EpiDoc). They are actively maintained and well-supported by a
            growing number of applications, and hence they currently represent “The Right Way” to
            produce digital texts.</p>
        <a name="Structure-not-presentation"/>
        <h5>Structure, not presentation<a href="#Structure-not-presentation" class="wiki-anchor"/>
        </h5>
        <p>We want to reflect the <em>structure</em> of text, and not the <em>presentation</em> of
            the text on the pages of a printed edition. This means that we typically do not encode
            formatting such as bold face, italics, centered text, and so on. Rather, we encode the
            logical features of the text that these formatting decisions represent. Although TEI
            provides a rendering attribute (<code>@rend</code>) for many elements, we do not
            recommend using it: if text is rendered in a certain way, try to figure out <em>why</em>
            it is rendered that way, and then encode the structural reasons for that presentational
            choice. Thus, if a text is centered on the page because it represents a colophon, use
                <code>&lt;trailer&gt;</code> rather than <code>&lt;p rend="center"&gt;</code>.</p>
        <a name="Getting-started"/>
        <h5>Getting started<a href="#Getting-started" class="wiki-anchor"/>
        </h5>
        <p>All SARIT documents start the same way. The file begins with an <em>XML declaration</em>,
            a processing instruction that tells whatever program opens the document that it is
            written in XML. This XML declaration is always the
            same:</p>
            <pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
</pre>
            <p>All valid XML
            files must have one, and only one, <em>top-level element</em>. Since SARIT documents are
            TEI documents, this top-level element is going to be &lt;TEI&gt;. This means that the
            second line of the file, after the XML declaration, will look something like the
            following:</p>
            <pre>
&lt;TEI xml:id="sarit__XML-ID_HERE" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"&gt;
</pre>
            <p>This
            element has two attributes. The <code>xml:id</code> is a unique identifier for the
            document. Your choice for this unique identifier will depend on your project. The
                <code>xmlns</code> attribute tells whatever program opens the document that the
            names of the XML elements are the names defined by the Text Encoding Initiative: for
            example, that the element <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is what the TEI defines as
                <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, and not what any other authority defines as
                <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>.</p>
        <p>The last line of the document will close the <code>&lt;TEI&gt;</code> element, and hence
            it will always be <code>&lt;/TEI&gt;</code>.</p>
        <a name="Further-details"/>
        <h5>Further details<a href="#Further-details" class="wiki-anchor"/>
        </h5>
        <a name="Comments"/>
        <h6>Comments<a href="#Comments" class="wiki-anchor"/>
        </h6>
        <p>The XML processor will ignore anything that is contained between <code>&lt;!--</code> and
                <code>--&gt;</code>.</p>
        <a name="The-xmlid-and-xmllang-attributes"/>
        <h6>The xml:id and xml:lang attributes<a href="#The-xmlid-and-xmllang-attributes" class="wiki-anchor"/>
        </h6>
        <p>The <code>xml:id</code> attribute assigns a unique identifier to an element, so that the
            element can be referenced from anywhere else in the document, or even in a corpus of
            documents. But the functions that depend on unique identifiers—indexing and cataloguing,
            for example—are better left to automatic processes. And since <code>xml:id@s need to be
                unique, and need to have a certain format (NCName), it’s easy for humans to
                introduce errors that will throw a wrench into these automatic processes. That’s why
                SARIT recommends _against_ the use of @xml:id</code> attributes within a document.
            If @xml:id@s are needed for technical reasons, it’s better to let those technical
            reasons determine how these @xml:id@s are to be generated and assigned. A document will
            still be valid if you use @xml:id@s, and there are certain cases (such as referencing
            readings in a critical apparatus to the main text) where you might find @xml:id@s
            useful. But in general, nothing is lost by omitting @xml:id@s, and often compatability
            with certain programs (such as SARIT’s XML database) is gained by omitting them.</p>
         <p>The <code>xml:lang</code> attribute, on the other hand, should be
        used systematically and carefully when preparing a SARIT document. This attribute tells us
        what language is represented by the text of the element to which it is attached. SARIT
        follows the two-letter language codes defined by <a href="/redmine/projects/encoding-guidelines/wiki/ISO_639?parent=Wiki" class="wiki-page new">http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/</a>, and in most cases
        these language codes are followed by a code for the script, as follows: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>en</code>: English (in the Latin script by default);</li>
            <li>
                <code>sa-Latn</code>: Sanskrit in the Latin script (Roman transliteration);</li>
            <li>
                <code>sa-Deva</code>: Sanskrit in the Devanāgarī script.</li>
            <li>
                <code>pra-Latn</code>: Prakrit in the Latin script (Roman transliteration);</li>
            <li>
                <code>pra-Deva</code>: Prakrit in the Devanāgarī script.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>See SARIT’s <strong>character-encoding guidelines</strong> regarding issues of script and
            transliteration.</p>
        <p>The <code>xml:lang</code> attribute is <em>heritable</em>: if you say that a certain
            element is in a certain language, then all of the children of that element are assumed
            to be in the language as well. Thus we need to specify a language at the highest level
            of its occurrence: <code>&lt;teiHeader&gt;</code> will almost always take the attribute
                <code>xml:lang="en"</code>, and <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> will almost always take
            the attribute <code>xml:lang="sa-Deva"</code> or <code>xml:lang="sa-Latn"</code> (see
            above). Apart from this initial specification, we only need to specify the language of
            an element if it is different from the language of its parent element: for example, if
            you have an English note to a Sanskrit text, you will generally give the
                <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> element the <code>xml:lang="en"</code> attribute.</p>
        <a name="Dealing-with-whitespace"/>
        <h6>Dealing with whitespace<a href="#Dealing-with-whitespace" class="wiki-anchor"/>
        </h6>
        <p>Because XML uses tags rather than whitespace elements (line-breaks and indentation) to mark
            the logical structure of the document, XML has no hard-and-fast rules for whitespace: a
            single element, consisting of a starting-tag, content, and an ending-tag, might occur on
            one, three, or forty lines. Different text editors also have different conventions for
            putting whitespace into XML documents.</p>
        <p>XML processors usually trim the whitespace at the beginning and end of an element. (See
                <a class="external" href="http://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/XML_Whitespace#Trimming.">http://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/XML_Whitespace#Trimming.</a>) Usually this will not
            change the actual text that you wish to encode. Whitespace requires attention, however,
            when within an element text and XML elements occur side-by-side, that is, when using
            inline XML elements (elements which have text before or after them). In cases like this,
            it’s important to put meaningful spaces <em>outside</em> of the inline tags rather than
            inside the tags,
            thus:<br/>
            <pre>
&lt;element&gt;XYZ &lt;element&gt;ABC&lt;/element&gt; XYZ&lt;/element&gt;
</pre>
        </p>
        <p>Rather
            than:<br/>
            <pre>
&lt;element&gt;XYZ&lt;element&gt; ABC &lt;/element&gt;XYZ&lt;/element&gt;
</pre>
        </p>
        <p>which will lose the spaces when it is processed.</p>
        <a name="The-TEI-Header"/>
        <h4>The TEI Header<a href="#The-TEI-Header" class="wiki-anchor"/>
        </h4>
         <p>One of the advantages of using TEI is the ability to include all
        kinds of structured metadata. When we create a SARIT document, we are not just transcribing
        the text, but also providing the following: </p><ul>
            <li>
                <em>cataloguing</em> information, for example the title and author of the text;</li>
            <li>information about the document’s <em>source</em>, such as the edition that the
                digital text is based upon;</li>
            <li>
                <em>legal</em> information, such as the license and authority under which the text
                is made available;</li>
            <li>information about the <em>encoding</em> of the document; and</li>
            <li>information about the <em>revisions</em> that have been made to the document over
                the course of its history.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All of this information is provided in a section of the document called the
                <em>header</em>, which is contained in the element <code>&lt;teiHeader&gt;</code>.
                <code>&lt;teiHeader&gt;</code> is a direct child of the top-level element
                <code>&lt;TEI&gt;</code>. And since the metadata will typically be in English, we
            typically specify the language of the <code>&lt;teiHeader&gt;</code> element with
                <code>xml:lang="en"</code>. The TEI Header has three obligatory sections: one for
            the description of the file (<code>&lt;fileDesc&gt;</code>), one for the description of
            the file’s encoding (<code>&lt;encodingDesc&gt;</code>), and one to record the file’s
            history (<code>&lt;revisionDesc&gt;</code>). We’ll talk about these three sections in
            order. But SARIT also provides a template document that shows how the header should be
            structured (<a class="external" href="https://github.com/sarit/SARIT-corpus/blob/master/00-sarit-tei-header-template.xml">https://github.com/sarit/SARIT-corpus/blob/master/00-sarit-tei-header-template.xml</a>).</p>
        <p>It is important to distinguish between the <strong>work</strong> and a specific
                <strong>representation</strong> of that work. A <strong>work</strong> is an abstract
            object, such as <em>Hamlet</em> or <em>Abhijñānaśakuntalā</em> considered as ideas in
            the mind. A printed edition of a work and a digital edition of a work are both
                <strong>representations</strong>. In most cases a specific printed edition will be
            the <strong>source</strong> of the digital edition and must be acknowledged as such.
            Since printed editions are protected by copyright laws—although not to the same degree 
            in all jurisdictions—you must ensure that you are legally
            entitled to use the printed edition as the source of the digital edition.</p>
        <a name="The-file-description"/>
        <h5>The file description<a href="#The-file-description" class="wiki-anchor"/>
        </h5>
        <p>The file description element (<code>&lt;fileDesc&gt;</code>) contains the most essential
            metadata: a statement of the title and author of the text, which is essential for
            cataloguing and indexing (<code>&lt;titleStmt&gt;</code>); a statement of how, under
            what authority, and under what license the digital text is published
                (<code>&lt;publicationStmt&gt;</code>), and a description of the digital text’s
            sources (<code>&lt;sourceDesc&gt;</code>).</p>
        <a name="The-title-statement"/>
        <h6>The title statement<a href="#The-title-statement" class="wiki-anchor"/>
        </h6>
        <p>The title statement supplies the title and author <em>of the digital text</em>. In most
            cases this will be the same as the title and author <em>of the work</em>. For
            example:<br/>
            <pre>
&lt;titleStmt&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Sarasvatīkaṇṭhābharaṇa&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;author&gt;Bhoja&lt;/author&gt;
&lt;/titleStmt&gt;
</pre>
        </p>
        <p>Very often, however, the SARIT edition will present a work along with one or more
            commentaries (see “Base texts and commentaries” below). In this case, there are two (or
            more) titles, and two (or more) authors. To reflect the fact that the title of the base
            text will be the main title of the document, we use the attributes <code>type</code> and
                <code>subtype</code>, and the authors are distinguished by their <code>role</code>
            attribute, as
            follows:<br/>
            <pre>
&lt;titleStmt&gt;
  &lt;title type="main" subtype="base-text"&gt;Tattvasaṅgraha&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;title type="sub" subtype="commentary"&gt;Tattvasaṅgrahapañjikā&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;author role="base-author"&gt;Śāntarakṣita&lt;/author&gt;
  &lt;author role="commentator"&gt;Kamalaśīla&lt;/author&gt;
&lt;/titleStmt&gt;
</pre>
        </p>
        <p>In the following example we have a base text and two commentaries. When there is only one
            author for each <code>role</code>, it is easy to link authors with the titles of their
            works. But when there are more than one author for each role—as is the case with
            multiple commentaries—we need to supply extra an extra <code>n</code>
            attribute.<br/>
            <pre>
&lt;titleStmt&gt;
  &lt;title type="main" subtype="base-text"&gt;Aṣṭāṅgahṛdayasaṃhitā&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;title type="sub" subtype="commentary" n="1"&gt;Sarvāṅgasundarā&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;title type="sub" subtype="commentary" n="2"&gt;Āyurvedarasāyana&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;author role="base-author"&gt;Vāgbhaṭa&lt;/author&gt;
  &lt;author role="commentator" n="1"&gt;Aruṇadatta&lt;/author&gt;
  &lt;author role="commentator" n="2"&gt;Hemādri&lt;/author&gt;
&lt;/titleStmt&gt;
</pre>
        </p>
        <p>In addition to providing information about <em>who</em> produced the work that forms the
            basis of the digital text, namely the author, the title statement also provides
            information about <em>who</em> helped to produce the digital text. This includes funding
            agencies, principal investigators, data enterers, and so on.</p>
        <p>The funding agency and principal investigator have their own TEI elements
                (<code>&lt;funder&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;principal&gt;</code>), but it is good
            practice to encode the names of persons with the general-purpose element
                <code>&lt;persName&gt;</code> (further uses of <code>&lt;persName&gt;</code> will be
            discussed in the full version of the
            guidelines):<br/>

         <p>The publication statement tells us how the digital text
            (<em>not</em> the sources of the digital text) is published. SARIT editions will have a
        publication statement with the following structure, although the TEI P5 <a href="/redmine/projects/encoding-guidelines/wiki/Guidelines?parent=Wiki" class="wiki-page new">http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/HD.html#HD24</a> offer additional
        possibilities: </p><ul>
            <li>the <em>publisher</em> of the digital text (typically SARIT);</li>
            <li>its <em>availability</em>;</li>
            <li>the <em>date</em> of its publication;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Texts that are made available through SARIT should
            include:<br/>
            <pre>
&lt;publisher&gt;SARIT&lt;/publisher&gt;
</pre>
        </p>
        <p>The availability of a text can either be <em>free</em> or <em>restricted</em>, which are
            the two possible values of the attribute <code>status</code> in the element
                <code>&lt;availability&gt;</code>. Unless there are special circumstances, SARIT
            texts are made available under a Creative Commons licence. This means that their
            availability is <em>restricted</em>, since CC licences put restrictions on the further
            use and reuse of documents. (<em>Free</em> in this case does not refer to cost; all
            SARIT texts are available free of cost.) SARIT texts will therefore usually include a
                <code>&lt;licence&gt;</code> element that either links to or reproduces this
            licence. Here is an example of an element that links to the CC
            license:<br/>
            <pre>

        <p>The <em>date</em> of publication is simply contained in the <code>&lt;date&gt;</code>

        <h6>The source description<a href="#The-source-description" class="wiki-anchor"/>
        </h6>
        <p>The last obligatory portion of the file description is the source description, which
            tells us the sources on which the digital text is based. This will often be the most
            extensive and detailed part of the TEI Header. Usually, there will be one edition that
            the digital text is primarily based on. We want to distinguish this “main source” from
            other sources that supplement the main source, or “second-level” sources (the sources of
            the digital document’s sources). Thus, by convention, the <em>first</em> element in the
            source description is understood to be the main source. In order to be completely
            explicit, however, SARIT recommends that the role of each source in the constitution of
            the digital document should be briefly explained with a <code>&lt;note&gt;</code>.</p>
        <p>TEI provides a number of ways of tagging bibliographic information, but SARIT recommends
            the use of <code>&lt;bibl&gt;</code>. This is a relatively flexible element which should
            accommodate book, articles in journals, and articles in collections. The following are
            examples for different kinds of printed sources. The most common is a book, which has
            one or more titles (<code>&lt;title&gt;</code>), one or more authors
                (<code>&lt;author&gt;</code>), usually one or more editors
                (<code>&lt;editor&gt;</code>), and the standard publication information
                (<code>&lt;publisher&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;pubPlace&gt;</code>, and
                <code>&lt;date&gt;</code>). Note that it is best practice to encode <em>names</em>
            of modern-day authors and editors using the <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> element and its
            sub-elements, <code>&lt;surname&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;forename&gt;</code>, in order
            to make it easier to sort and reformat bibliographic
            entries.<br/>

        <p>Here is an example for journal articles, demonstrating the use of the <code>level</code>
            attribute to distinguish between the title of the article (<code>&lt;title

                level="j"&gt;</code>). Note also the use of the <code>&lt;biblScope&gt;</code>

        <p>The sources for our printed editions are almost always manuscript sources. And when the
            printed editions refer to these manuscript sources, as responsible editions do, it is
            useful to provide a description of the manuscript that readers of the digital text will
            be able to refer to. The proper element for this description is
                <code>&lt;msDesc&gt;</code>, and it is contained directly within the
                <code>&lt;sourceDesc&gt;</code> element, alongside any bibliographic sources
                (<code>&lt;bibl&gt;</code>).</p>
        <p>Here is one
            example:<br/>
            <pre>
&lt;msDesc&gt;

        <h5>The encoding description<a href="#The-encoding-description" class="wiki-anchor"/>
        </h5>
        <p>After the file description, TEI documents require an encoding description
                (<code>&lt;encodingDesc&gt;</code>). The purpose of the encoding description is to
            document the choices that were made in encoding the text, especially if there may be
            uncertainty or ambiguity, for instance regarding how the different layers of base text
            and commentary are represented in the TEI document.</p>
        <p>
            <em>At the moment SARIT provides no specific guidelines for the encoding
                description.</em> The <code>&lt;encodingDesc&gt;</code> element of SARIT texts
            generally consists of prose paragraphs (<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>) that explain the
            encoding choices specific to the text. There should be no need of noting encoding
            decisions that conform to these guidelines. We do, however, recommend the use of three
            elements that are available in the encoding description:
                <code>&lt;projectDesc&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;tagsDecl&gt;</code>, and
                <code>&lt;refsDecl&gt;</code>.</p>
        <p>The project description (<code>&lt;projectDesc&gt;</code>) is a paragraph or two that
            describes the project or projects which resulted in the creation of the digital
            text:<br/>
            <pre>
&lt;projectDesc&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Producing as part of the NEH-DFG project “Enriching Digital Texts Collections in Indology” from 2012 to 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/projectDesc&gt;
</pre>
        </p>
        <p>The tagging declaration (<code>&lt;tagsDecl&gt;</code>) may be used to document the usage
            of specific tags in the text and their rendition if applicable (see the TEI P5
            guidelines: <a class="external" href="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/HD.html#HD57">http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/HD.html#HD57</a>). Most
            projects will not use the tagging declaration.</p>
        <p>The reference declaration (<code>&lt;refsDecl&gt;</code>), however, is important: it
            describes the reference system used in the text. It may be a pattern of canonical
            references (see the full guidelines for more details), or it may simply describe the
            structure of the text in English prose, as
            follows:<br/>
            <pre>
&lt;refsDecl&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;References in this text are either in the format w.x.z or w.x.y.z.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;w represents the &lt;att&gt;n&lt;/att&gt; attribute of the highest-level 
    &lt;gi&gt;div&lt;/gi&gt; element (an adhyāya).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;x represents the &lt;att&gt;n&lt;/att&gt; attribute of the second-highest-level
    &lt;gi&gt;div&lt;/gi&gt; element (a pāda).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;y represents the &lt;att&gt;n&lt;/att&gt; attribute of the third-highest-level
    &lt;gi&gt;div&lt;/gi&gt; element (an adhikaraṇa).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;z represents the &lt;att&gt;n&lt;/att&gt; attribute of the fourth-highest-level
    &lt;gi&gt;div&lt;/gi&gt; element, which contains the text of a sūtra along with
    any portion of the commentary that specifically concerns that 
    sūtra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/refsDecl&gt;

                <code>when</code> attribute. The <code>&lt;change&gt;</code> elements will typically
            include a list of changes, as below (note that <code>&lt;list&gt;</code> should be a
            child of <code>&lt;change&gt;</code>, not
            <code>&lt;revisionDesc&gt;</code>):<br/>

</pre>
        </p>
        <p>Prose paragraphs (&lt;p&gt;) are also permitted in &lt;change&gt; elements, but lists are

        <h4>Base texts and commentaries<a href="#Base-texts-and-commentaries" class="wiki-anchor"/>
        </h4>
        <p>The rest of these guidelines will concern the text’s data rather than its metadata. All
            of this data is contained in the element <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> that immediately
            follows the TEI Header. The <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> element must contain a
                <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element which represents the body of the text; it might
            also contain <code>&lt;front&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;back&gt;</code> elements,
            representing any front matter or back matter, respectively. The
                <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> element must also have an <code>xml:lang</code> attribute
            that tells us what language and what script the text contained therein is written in.
            Here is an example for a text encoded in Roman
            transliteration:<br/>
            <pre>
&lt;text xml:lang="sa-Latn"&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
  ....
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/text&gt;
</pre>
            <br/>And
            an example for a text encoded in
            Devanāgarī:<br/>
            <pre>
&lt;text xml:lang="sa-Deva"&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
  ....
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/text&gt;
</pre>
        </p>
        <p>The <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> element is the last child element of
                <code>&lt;TEI&gt;</code>.</p>
        <p>A single document might contain more than one text. In
        particular, a single document will very often contain a commentary together with the text
        that it is a commentary on, hence known as the “base text.” You may only be interested in
        the base text, or only in the commentary. But you may also want to encode <em>both</em>
        texts, and in that case you will also want to make the relationship between the texts
        explicit. There are, in general, two options for encoding a base text with its commentary: </p><ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Together</strong>. The base text and the commentary are encoded in a single
                document.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Separate</strong>. The base text and the commentary are encoded in separate
                documents. They are linked to each other (i.e., the commentary includes references
                to the base text) through the procedures described in the full version of the
                guidelines.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, SARIT includes a text of the <em>Daśarūpaka</em> of Dhanañjaya, together
            with the <em>Avaloka</em> commentary by Dhanañjaya’s brother Dhanika. These two texts
            are encoded in a single document. A further commentary on the two texts, the
                <em>Laghuṭīkā</em> of Bhaṭṭa Nṛsiṃha, is encoded in a separate document that refers
            back to the original document.</p>
        <p>Generally speaking, if the base text and commentary are printed in the same register on
            the page (the base text being in a larger font or in bold, see below example 1), it
            makes sense to encode them together; if the base text and commentary are printed in
            separate registers (see below example 2), it is easier to encode them separately.</p>
        <p>These guidelines will tell you how to encode the base text and the commentary
                <strong>together</strong>. Please consult the full version for guidance on how to
            encode them <strong>separately</strong>.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Example 1</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="resources/img/ex-embedded-base-pvv.jpg" title="base text embedded in commentary" alt="base text embedded in commentary"/>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Example 2</strong>
            <br/>
            <img src="resources/img/ex-base-text_commentary.jpg" title="base text and commentary" alt="base text and commentary"/>
        </p>
        <a name="The-base-text-is-a-quotation"/>
        <h5>The base text is a quotation<a href="#The-base-text-is-a-quotation" class="wiki-anchor"/>
        </h5>
        <p>SARIT recommends a model in which the base text is “embedded” in the commentary. In other
            words, we presume that everything in the &lt;text&gt; element represents the commentary
                <em>unless specified otherwise</em>. The rest of this section will deal with how to
            specify otherwise.</p>
        <p>When a base text is included or embedded within a commentary, SARIT treats it as a
            special kind of <em>quotation</em>. It should therefore be enclosed within the tag
                <code>&lt;quote&gt;</code>, which TEI uses for quoted material, and this tag will
            have the attribute <code>type="base-text"</code>. Theoretically we should be able to
            extract the base text from the commentary by pulling out all of the &lt;quote
            type="base-text"&gt; elements. In the following example the verse आनन्दनिष्यन्दिषु etc.
            is marked as belonging to the base text, because it is contained within the &lt;quote
            type="base-text"&gt;
            element:<br/>
            <pre>
&lt;p&gt;इदं प्रकरणं दशरूपज्ञानफलम् । दशरूपज्ञानं किंफलमित्याह—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;quote type="base-text"&gt;
  &lt;lg n="6"&gt;
    &lt;l&gt;आनन्दनिष्यन्दिषु रूपकेषु व्युत्पत्तिमात्रं फलमल्पबुद्धिः ।&lt;/l&gt;
    &lt;l&gt;योऽपीतिहासादिवदाह साधुस्तस्मै नमः स्वादपराङ्मुखाय ॥&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;/lg&gt;
&lt;/quote&gt;
</pre>
        </p>
        <p>As in the above example, we recommend making the <code>&lt;quote&gt;</code> element that
            contains the base text a <em>sibling</em> rather than a <em>child</em> of the elements
            of the commentary (<code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and so on). That is, the
                <code>&lt;quote&gt;</code> element should be a child of the same structural division
            (see below) as the elements of the commentary.</p>
        <a name="Enclose-the-base-text-and-commentary-in-a-division"/>
        <h5>Enclose the base text and commentary in a division<a href="#Enclose-the-base-text-and-commentary-in-a-division" class="wiki-anchor"/>
        </h5>
        <p>In almost every case, the structure of the base text and commentary will be the same.
            This means that a given reference, such as 1.4.5, should be able to identify both the
            base text and the corresponding section of commentary. The easiest way to accomplish
            this is to <em>put the base text and the corresponding section of commentary within a
                single structural division</em>. This enclosing division is meant to gather the two
            texts together for the purposes of display and reference.</p>
        <p>The “section of a commentary” that corresponds to a section of the base text will often
            take the form of an optional <em>avataraṇikā</em>, the base text, and then a more
            extensive commentary. This should all be enclosed within a &lt;div&gt; element, as
            follows:</p>
        <p>

&lt;p&gt;तथा हि । ... न शब्दसंगतः । (२४९)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
        <p>Note that an <code>n</code> attribute is assigned to the enclosing division. This is
            optional, but it helps to identify the section of the commentary with the verse-number
            of the base text that it comments upon (which is identical with the <code>n</code>
            attribute of the quoted <code>&lt;lg&gt;</code> element). The enclosing division may
            also have a <code>type</code> attribute, such as <code>type="sūtra"</code>, which tells
            us that it gathers the portion of the commentary that concerns a given sūtra. This
            attribute, too, is optional.</p>

            <em>avataraṇikā</em>:<br/>

        </h5>
        <p>It may be the case that a commentary will skip one section of the base text, or comment
            on several sections of the base text at the same time. In such cases, the enclosing
            division will simply include more than one section of the base text. The label
                (<code>n</code>) for this division will include all of the sections of the base text
            that are comprised in the division. For example, a section of commentary that comments
            upon two sūtras of the base
            text:<br/>

        </h5>
        <p>Sometimes what we think of as a single section of the base text (a verse, paragraph,
            etc.) is split up between several sections of commentary: for example, the commentary
            might take individual words from the base text in turn. Although the underlying
            principle is the same—put the base text elements within an enclosing division that also
            includes the commentary—the base text elements in this case will be fragmented, and we
            need to provide enough information to allow the structure of the base text to be
            reconstituted. Thus the elements of the base text should be labelled as specified below
            (in the “verse fragments” section).</p>
        <a name="Sections-of-the-text"/>
        <h4>Sections of the text<a href="#Sections-of-the-text" class="wiki-anchor"/>
        </h4>
        <p>There are many Sanskrit words for sections of a text: sarga,
        adhyāya, aṅka, pariccheda, ucchvāsa, etc. The encoding of these sections should meet several
        requirements: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>the XML document itself should be valid;</li>
            <li>the structure of the XML document reflects the logical structure of the text;</li>
            <li>a standard reference system should be able to use the structure of the XML document
                as a proxy for the structure of the text;</li>
            <li>texts in the corpus are broadly consistent in the encoding strategy used for these
                sections.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These considerations lead us to recommend the use of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> for all
            "parts," "sections," and "divisions" in the text, whatever their Sanskrit name is, and
            at whatever depth they occur. Do <strong>not</strong> use the numbered divisions
            available in earlier versions of the TEI Guidelines (<code>&lt;div1&gt;</code>,
                <code>&lt;div2&gt;</code>, etc.).</p>
        <p>Before encoding a text, you should figure out a strategy for representing all of the
            relevant levels of the text as <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements. Some Mīmāṃsā texts,
            for example, are organized according to the hierarchical organization of the Mīmāṃsā
            Sūtras into adhyāyas, pādas, and adhikaraṇas. The first <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> beneath
            the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element (<code>body/div</code>) will thus correspond to an
            adhyāya, the first <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> below this to a pāda
                (<code>body/div/div</code>), and the first <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> below this
                (<code>body/div/div/div</code>) to an adhikaraṇa. If this schema is applied
            consistently, there is no need for assigning a type to the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>
            elements themselves (e.g., <code>&lt;div type="adhyāya"&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;div
                type="pāda"&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;div type="adhikaraṇa"&gt;</code>), but these
                <code>type</code> attributes may be included in order to make the XML easier to
            read.</p>
        <p>The strategy followed in the text can be, and should be, documented in the reference
            declaration (<code>&lt;refsDecl&gt;</code>), which is part of the encoding description
                (<code>&lt;encodingDesc&gt;</code>) in the TEI Header (see above).</p>
        <a name="Labelling-sections"/>
        <h5>Labelling sections<a href="#Labelling-sections" class="wiki-anchor"/>
        </h5>
        <p>Sections of the text should be <em>identifiable</em>. In order to be identifiable to
            humans, sections generally carry a heading and/or a trailer (see below). In order to be
            identifiable to machines, sections carry a numeric <em>label</em> that is represented by
            the <code>n</code> attribute of the corresponding <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element. The
            value of <code>@n</code> will usually be the serial number of the section: <code>&lt;div
                n="2"&gt;</code> represents the second division (adhyāya, pāda, adhikaraṇa, etc.),
            even if it's not actually the second <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element within its parent
            element. For division that comprises more than one such section, we simply put all of
            the corresponding numbers in the <code>n</code> attribute: <code>&lt;div n="2 3
                4"&gt;</code>.</p>
        <p>Divisions (&lt;div&gt;s) are block-level elements, and they constitute the text
            hierarchy, together with other block-level elements like paragraphs
                (<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>), verses (<code>&lt;lg&gt;</code>), and the “anonymous
            blocks” used for sūtras and the like (<code>&lt;ab&gt;</code>). The overall reference
            system of the text will therefore usually include the numbering of
                <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements at the upper levels and the numbering of
                <code>&lt;lg&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;ab&gt;</code> elements at the lower levels.</p>

        </h5>
        <p>Headings and trailers are short “paratexts” that announce the beginning or end of a
            section. These may be original to the text, or added by scribes or even the editor: the
            general rule, however, is that if it is included in the printed text, it should be
            included in the digital text; if you determine that the editor or a scribe was in fact
            responsible for adding some or all of these “paratexts,” TEI allows you to hold him
            responsible and ultimately filter out such interventions if desired. See “holding people
            responsible” in the SARIT Full guidelines.</p>
        <a name="Headings"/>
        <h6>Headings<a href="#Headings" class="wiki-anchor"/>
        </h6>
        <p>Some sections of the text will begin with a heading, most often a short introductory
            phrase (e.g., अथ भावाधिकरणम्). We encode these heading with the TEI element
                <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>. There can be more than one <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>
            element at the beginning of a section:</p>
        <pre>
&lt;text xml:lang="sa-Deva"&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;श्रीः&lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;अभिनवभारती&lt;/head&gt;
  ...
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/text&gt;
</pre>
        <p>In addition to the headings printed in the text, the heading element is a convenient
            place to put chapter or section titles for a table of contents, especially if there are
            no printed headings, or if they would be unsuitable for a table of contents. This is
            also a way to use English or transliterated titles within a Sanskrit text (using, of
            course, the relevant <code>xml:lang</code> attribute). You are therefore encouraged to
            use the special element <code>&lt;head type="toc"&gt;</code>, which will supply the
            title of the section in question to the table of contents, but which is itself
            suppressed in the browsing display on the SARIT website. For
            example:<br/>
            <pre>
&lt;div n="1"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;अथ प्रथमपरिच्छेदः&lt;/head&gt;

        <p>SARIT uses the TEI element <code>&lt;trailer&gt;</code> for those short pieces of text
            (often called colophons) that come at the end of a section. <code>&lt;trailer&gt;</code>
            should typically be the final element in the element that it

            edition for purposes of reference. (The digital text will have its own lineation and
            pagination depending on the media in which it is viewed.) These are encoded as
            “milestone” elements, that is, single elements that mark the transition from one unit to
            the text. Sometimes other kinds of milestones besides lines and pages are noted in
            source editions, for example manuscript folios. Specific guidelines for the use of these
            elements are provided below.</p>

            <em>If you choose to encode line-breaks at all, every single line-break of the source
                edition must be explicitly represented in the digital texts.</em> Whenever a new
            line begins in the source edition, the element <code>&lt;lb/&gt;</code> must appear,
            whether it occurs within a prose paragraph, or at the end of a prose paragraph; within a
            metrical line of verse, or at the end of such a line. If line-breaks are encoded
            consistently, there is no need to assign them a numeric label, because the line-number
            can be automatically determined</p>
        <p>The <code>&lt;lb/&gt;</code> element is assumed to refer to line-breaks in the principal
            source of the digital text. (If you wish to encode line-breaks of another edition, use
            the <code>ed</code> attribute to refer to it, and see the section on internal references
            in the full version of the guidelines.)</p>
        <p>SARIT distinguishes two types of line breaks:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>an <code>&lt;lb/&gt;</code> between words: e.g., उक्तं &lt;lb/&gt;च</li>
            <li>an <code>&lt;lb/&gt;</code> in the middle of a word, and thus after an end-of-line
                hyphen. SARIT uses the <code>break</code> attribute to specify that the element "is
                considered not to mark the end of any adjacent orthographic token"; the hyphen
                itself is <em>not</em> encoded. For example: <code>शं&lt;lb
                    break="no"/&gt;करः</code>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>The pagination of the source edition is encoded by placing the element
                <code>&lt;pb/&gt;</code> (for "page break") at the beginning of every new page. In
            contrast to line-breaks, SARIT requires the <code>&lt;pb/&gt;</code> element to have a
            numeric label (<code>n</code>) that corresponds to the page number. But like
            line-breaks, SARIT uses the <code>break</code> attribute to distinguish between page
            breaks that occur between words (e.g., <code>उपपन्नम् । &lt;pb n="2"/&gt;यदि च</code>)
            and page breaks that occur within a word (e.g., <code>उपप&lt;pb n="2"
                break="no"/&gt;न्नम् । यदि च</code>). And also like line-breaks, we assume that the
            breaking element and the corresponding number refer by default to the principal source
            edition.</p>

        <p>Manuscript folios are treated as pages, so the beginning of a new manuscript folio (or a
            new side of a manuscript folio) is encoded with the <code>&lt;pb&gt;</code> element.
            These elements have an <code>@ed</code> attribute that refers to the manuscript (the

        <p>SARIT uses the <code>&lt;lg&gt;</code> element, a “line group,” for metrical verses. A
            verse contains a number of metrical <em>lines</em>, which are encoded with the
                <code>&lt;l&gt;</code> element. You can think of a <em>line</em> in the context of
            verse as anything that ends in a daṇḍa or a double daṇḍa. The only things permitted in
            the <code>&lt;lg&gt;</code> element are line elements (<code>&lt;l&gt;</code>) and
            labels (<code>&lt;label&gt;</code>). Verses that are numbered in the edition should also
            be given a label (<code>n</code>) by which they can be easily identified. Generally the
            verse numbers in the printed text, however, should also be represented as text. That is,
            the number of the verse is included both in the <code>n</code> attribute of the verse
            element <code>&lt;lg&gt;</code>, and at the end of the second line, as
            follows:<br/>
            <pre>
&lt;lg n="1"&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;वागर्थाविव संपृक्तौ वागर्थप्रतिपत्तये ।&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;जगतः पितरौ वन्दे पार्वतीपरमेश्वरौ ॥ १ ॥&lt;/l&gt;
&lt;/lg&gt;
</pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Metrical lines are not typographic lines</em>. A typographic line break, encoded as
                <code>&lt;lb/&gt;</code>, might occur in the middle of, or at the end of, a metrical
            line. A metrical line usually consists of two metrical quarters (pādas), and thus a
            verse usually consists of four quarters. The juncture between two quarters is a kind of
            break or pause, and therefore we encode it using the TEI element
                <code>&lt;caesura/&gt;</code>.</p>
        <p>Why do we use both <code>&lt;caesura/&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;lb/&gt;</code>? The
                <code>&lt;caesura/&gt;</code> element encodes an element of metrical structure that
            often motivates or explains the way the verse has been set on the page in the source
            edition. The <code>&lt;lb/&gt;</code> element may thus coincide with a
                <code>&lt;caesura/&gt;</code> element, but its primary purpose is to <em>count the
                number of line breaks on a page</em>. For example, a digital text that does not
            render line-breaks at all might encode the following
            verse:<br/>
            <pre>
  &lt;lg&gt;
    &lt;l&gt;स्वसुखनिरभिलाषः खिद्यसे लोकहेतोः&lt;caesura/&gt; प्रतिदिनमथवा ते वृत्तिरेवंविधैव ।&lt;/l&gt;

  &lt;/lg&gt;
</pre>
        </p>
        <p>The lineation of the source edition does not always reflect this structure.
            Here is one possible
            representation:<br/>
            <pre>
  &lt;lg&gt;
    &lt;l&gt;स्वसुखनिरभिलाषः खिद्यसे &lt;lb/&gt;
      लोकहेतोः&lt;caesura/&gt; प्रतिदिनमथवा ते वृत्तिरेवंविधैव ।&lt;/l&gt;
    &lt;l&gt;अनुभवति हि मूर्ध्ना पादपस्तीव्रमुष्णं&lt;caesura/&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;
      शमयति परितापं छाययोपाश्रितानाम् ॥&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;/lg&gt;
</pre>
        </p>
        <p>When the line is broken in the middle of a word, use the <code>break="no"</code>
            attribute rather than hard-coding a hyphen into the text, as noted in the section on
            milestones
            above:<br/>
            <pre>
  &lt;lg&gt;
    &lt;l&gt;तिष्ठन् भाति पितुः पुरो भुवि यथा सिंहासने किं तथा&lt;caesura/&gt;&lt;lb/&gt;यत् संवाहयतः सुखं हि चरणौ तातस्य किं राज्यतः ।&lt;/l&gt;

</pre>
        </p>
        <p>The common <em>āryā</em> meter and its relatives call for some comment: they are
            sometimes thought of as having four quarters, and sometimes not. SARIT recommends the
            use of the <code>&lt;caesura/&gt;</code> element to represent the <em>yati</em> between
            the first and second half of the line, when it is present; when the <em>yati</em> is
            absent, the <code>&lt;caesura/&gt;</code> element may be omitted. For
            example:<br/>
            <pre>
&lt;lg n="87"&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;हुअवह-पडित्त-णूमिअ-&lt;caesura/&gt;णिअ-णणुम्हा-विसंठुल-मह-ग्गाहं ।&lt;/l&gt;

        <h5>Fragments of verses<a href="#Fragments-of-verses" class="wiki-anchor"/>
        </h5>
        <p>Sometimes the parts of a verse are broken up within a text, for example when a
            commentator breaks up a verse to discuss its components separately. In these cases,
            every verse-fragment should be contained in an <code>&lt;lg&gt;</code> element with the
            attributes <code>next</code>, <code>prev</code>, or both.</p>
        <p>All of the verse-fragments should have an identifying label (a, b, c, etc.), e.g.
                <code>n="27c"</code>. The value of <code>next</code> and <code>prev</code> should
            refer to these identifying labels, e.g., <code>next="27d"</code>.</p>
        <p>The labelling convention will allow applications to identify “verse 27” as the sum of its
            parts in case there is no element <code>&lt;lg n="27"&gt;</code> to be found. However, it
            will not join fragmentary <code>&lt;l&gt;</code> elements into a single element.
            Therefore it is recommended to use the <code>part</code> attribute on any fragmentary
                <code>&lt;l&gt;</code> attributes: <code>I</code> for an initial fragment (e.g.,
            pādas a or c) and <code>F</code> for a final fragment (e.g., pādas b or d), or
                <code>M</code> for a medial fragment if such a case occurs.</p>

        <p>Often verses are “embedded” into paragraphs, and we reflect this fact by embedding the

        <p>Sūtras are like paragraphs, but they are often formatted differently (without
            indentation, for example) and they do not have the “semantic baggage” of a prose
            paragraph. SARIT recommends the use of the <code>&lt;ab&gt;</code> element (“anonymous
            block”) with the attribute <code>type="sutra"</code>.</p>
        <p>In the following example, the <code>&lt;ab&gt;</code> element includes, in addition to
            the text of the sutra, two typed labels that provide, respectively, the serial number of
            the adhikaraṇa in which the sutra occurs, and the position (<em>pūrvapakṣa</em>,
                <em>uttarapakṣa</em>, or <em>siddhānta</em>) that the sutra represents.</p>

        <p>SARIT uses the core elements of the TEI’s drama module for Sanskrit plays. Plays usually
            consist of divisions, such as an aṅka, in which various characters speak lines in prose
            or verse. The standard element for a “line” in this sense is <code>&lt;sp&gt;</code>:
            this contains the lines spoken by the character, either as prose
            (<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>) or verse (<code>&lt;lg&gt;</code>).</p>
        <p>The <code>&lt;sp&gt;</code> element may also contain a label for the speaker and stage
            directions. The speaker is encoded in the element <code>&lt;speaker&gt;</code>, and
            stage directions in the element <code>&lt;stage&gt;</code>. You should omit any
            formatting the editor has used to distinguish these elements.</p>

        <h4>Labels and notes<a href="#Labels-and-notes" class="wiki-anchor"/>
        </h4>
        <p>The source edition will sometimes have <strong>labels</strong> added by the editor, which
            help to identify sections (below the level of the sections explicitly encoded as
                <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements), positions in an argument (<em>pūrvapakṣa</em>,
                <em>uttarapakṣa</em>, <em>siddhānta</em>), or other features of the text. It will
            also sometimes have <strong>notes</strong>, whether those are represented as footnotes,
            endnotes, or otherwise. It is possible to represent both labels and notes using TEI’s
                <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> elements.</p>
        <p>Because SARIT recommends encoding <em>structure</em> rather than <em>presentation</em>,
            it is important to have an encoding strategy for representing various types of notes and
            labels, and to document this strategy in the encoding declaration of the header. For
            example, your text might list variant readings and references in the footnotes, and
            hence you might encode these notes as <code>&lt;note type="text-critical"&gt;</code> or
                <code>&lt;note type="reference"&gt;</code>. Similarly, it is recommended to find
            consistent <code>type</code> attributes for <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> elements as well,
            and to avoid the use of formatting-specific attributes (like <code>place</code> and
                <code>rend</code>).</p>
        <p>In the example below the labels might be encoded as
            follows:<br/>
            <pre>
&lt;label type="position"&gt;2&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;label type="position-person"&gt;भामहः&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;lg&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;अगोनिवृत्तिः शब्दार्थो यदि गौः केन गम्यताम् ।&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;गोशब्दं शृण्वतः पूर्वमगौः स्फुरतु चेतसि ॥ ५ ॥&lt;/l&gt;
&lt;/lg&gt;

        </p>
        <p>Notes are often represented in printed editions with a <em>note marker</em> in the main
            text, and the <em>note text</em> either at the bottom of the page (as footnotes) or at
            the end of the chapter or text (as endnotes). <em>SARIT embeds notes into the text in
                their proper place.</em> That is, wherever you see a note marker in the text, that
            is where you should place the <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> element.</p>
        <p>The content of the <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> element depends on the <code>type</code> of
            note that it represents. Typically, however, notes will contain a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>
            element. For text-critical notes, the simple version of the guidelines recommends the
            use of prose paragraphs; more sophisticated methods are available in the full version of
            the guidelines.</p>
        <p>Attention must also be paid to the <em>language</em> of the note, since in many cases it
            will differ from the language of the surrounding text. It is good practice to use the
                <code>xml:lang</code> attribute to identify the language of any element that differs
            from its parent element. This also includes sections of Sanskrit text quoted in notes,
            for which you may use the <code>&lt;foreign&gt;</code> element. For example:</p>

&lt;p&gt;यं नाट्यवेदं वेदेभ्यः सारमादाय ब्रह्मा कृतवान्, 
यत्संबद्धमभिनयं भरतश्चकार करणाङ्गहारानकरोत्&lt;note

        <p>Note, finally, that editors will often insert references <em>into the text itself</em>,
            and you are encouraged to use the <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> element for these additions,
            as in the following example. (See the full version of the guidelines for instructions
            regarding pointing references and canonical reference
            schemes.)<br/>

        <p>For the simple level of text encoding, we recommend encoding quotations “as-is.” That is,
            if the editor has used quotation marks or double quotation marks, put them into the
            digital text; if the editor has used bold-face text to represent quotations, use the
                <code>&lt;hi&gt;</code> tag (for “highlighted”). The reason for encoding quotations
            “as-is” is the possibility that identifying the beginning and end of quotations may
            require extensive checking by skilled readers, and the frequency with which quotations
            are represented inconsistently in printed editions. Of course, if project resources
            allow, quotations can be encoded by following the suggestions in the full version of the
            guidelines.</p>

        <h5>Where do I put इति?<a href="#Where-do-I-put-इति" class="wiki-anchor"/>
        </h5>
        <p>The particle इति, which marks quotations in Sanskrit, can be tricky: it often combines
            with the previous or following word, which can often mean that there is no typographic
            separation between a “verse” and the prose it’s embedded in. While there are ways of
            marking the beginning and ending of quotations, discussed more extensively in the SARIT
            Full guidelines, we don’t worry about quotations in SARIT Simple, and we are free to
            adopt the following straightforward principle: <em>follow the typography of the printed
                edition.</em>
        </p>
        <p>If the edition prints इति on the same line as the verse, include it there, within the
                <code>&lt;l&gt;</code> element; if it prints इति on a following line, then put it
            outside of the <code>&lt;lg&gt;</code> element.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Example 14: इति on the same line</strong>
            <br/>

                <strong>base text</strong>: The text on which the current text is a commentary.
                Since a <em>base text</em> only makes sense in relation to a commentary on it, this
                term is only used within a commentary. Sections of the <em>base text</em> that are
