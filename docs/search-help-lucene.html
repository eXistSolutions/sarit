                <h2>Lucene Search</h2>
                <p>In the SARIT app, a number of search options are available, making it also possible to perform quite advanced searches. 
                Lucene Full-Text search is based on the open source search engine <a href="http://lucene.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Lucene</a> and brings into play all the
                    options that Lucene provides. </p>
    <section>
        <h3>Search Strategies</h3>
        <p>There are searches – and searches.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>One can search by simply filling in words in the query field and press return (or
                click the magnifying glass).</li>
            <li>One can use the standard Lucene search options. These consists of marking which
                words you would like to occur as hits and which word must (or must not) occur, of
                stringing together words with AND, OR and NOT, grouping words with parentheses, and
                so on. Quite complicated searches can be made with these options.</li>
            <li>One can use Lucene wildcards - <code>?</code> for any single character and <code>*</code> for any sequence
                of zero, one or more characters.</li>
            <li>Even more advanced, one can use regular expressions, the most precise (and
                complicated) way of searching for texts strings.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All of these search options can be used in combination, so one can freely e.g. mix plain,
            wildcard and regular expression searches.</p>
        <p>These three different search strategies will be presented below, after a brief
            description of the way hits are displayed.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Hitlist and Search Relevance</h3>
        <p>When searching for books in a library catalogue, one can usually choose to have the hits
            displayed according to relevance or according to author, title or suchlike. In the
            SARIT app, hits from Lucene searches are only displayed according to relevance, according to a "score"
            computed for each search. The score is a quite complicated thing in itself, but
            basically, the more times your search terms occur in your search scope and the less
            common they are in the index (that is, in SARIT works) the higher the score they
            will get and the more prominent they will be in the hitlist. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Standard Lucene Syntax</h3>
        <p>In the following, examples are drawn from imaginary searches in Shakespeare's works. It is intended that somone knowledgable in Sanskrit convert the examples to something more relavant to SARIT.</p>
        <p>If you simply fill in some words in the query field, and do not use any of the special
            Lucene search operators, you are saying that you would like to see as many of the words
            in the search scope as possible.</p>
        <p>With Lucene standard syntax, there are two ways you can impose restrictions of the
            co-occurrence of search terms: you can either prefix words with + and - or you use the
            boolean terms AND, OR and NOT (written in upper-case). In both cases, you can
            additionally group your search expressions using parentheses.</p>
        <p>The option of using + and - is better suited to a search which orders hits according to
            score. Here you let words stand as they are (without + or -) if you would like all of
            them to occur in hits, but if there is only one of them present, you also want to have
            it displayed as a hit If you prefix one or more words with +, they must occur in a hit,
            and if you prefix them with -, they must not occur as a hit. If you search for <code>snake
            fillet</code> you get a lot of hits with either <code>snake</code> or <code>killed</code> and perhaps some with
            both. If you search for "snake +fillet, all your hits will contain <code>fillet</code>, but they
            may or may not contain <code>snake</code>. If you search for <code>snake -fillet</code>, you would get hits
            with <code>snake</code>, but only if they do not contain <code>fillet</code>.</p>
        <p>If you use AND, OR and NOT, the logic is rather different. If you search for <code>snake AND
            fillet</code> you get hits with both <code>snake</code> and <code>fillet</code> and none with only one of them. This
            corresponds to <code>+snake +killed</code>. If you search for <code>snake OR killed</code>, this is the same
            as simply searching for <code>snake fillet</code>. If you search for <code>snake NOT fillet</code>, this
            equals searching for <code>snake -fillet</code>.</p>
        <p>Searches can acquire higher complexity use of parentheses. Here the use of AND, OR and
            NOT may come more naturally. Say you want to find passages where the word <code>fillet</code>
            occurs but where also at least one of the words <code>snake</code>, <code>deer</code>, <code>bird</code> occurs. You can
            express this by <code>(snake OR deer OR bird) AND fillet</code>. An AND enforces "must occur" on
            both sides, so both one of the animals and the word <code>fillet</code> have to occur in the hits.
            Say (for some reason) you do not wish the words <code>pricket</code> and <code>mouse</code> to occur in your
            hits – you then embroider your search expression with <code>NOT (pricket OR mouse)</code> as
            <code>(snake OR deer OR bird) AND fillet NOT (pricket OR mouse)</code></p>
        <p>If you simply search for <code>pricket OR deer AND killed</code>, you will (because the AND rubs off
            to the left), search for passages where <code>deer</code> and <code>fillet</code> must occur, but you would
            also like <code>pricket</code> to be marked as a hit. You can enforce a certain logic on your query
            by grouping with parentheses.</p>
        <p>If you search for <code>(snake OR deer) AND fillet</code> you are saying that one or both of <code>snake</code>
            and <code>deer</code> must occur, as must <code>fillet</code>.</p>
        <p>If you search for <code>snake OR (deer AND fillet)</code>, you would like to retrieve hits where
            <code>snake</code> occurs and you would like to retrieve hits where <code>deer</code> and <code>fillet</code> go
            together. In practice this means that you will get a lot of <code>snake</code>-only hits.</p>
        <p>You can also nest parentheses, e.g. <code>(snake OR (deer AND fillet)) NOT pricket</code> will
            remove the hits with <code>pricket</code> from <code>snake OR (deer AND fillet</code>. </p>
        <p>As you can see, the options are many …. And as if this was not enough, there is also
            regex – and regex syntax combined with standard syntax!</p>
    </section>
    <h3>Phrase Search</h3>
    <p>A phrase search searches for a series of words in sequence. You activate phrase search by
        enclosing the words in quotations marks. If you want to search for all occurences of "fenny
        snake", you should input the search expression <code>"fenny snake"</code>. This is the way
        searches are performed in word processing documents, except that here punctuation is
        disregarded. To find "Fire burn, and cauldron bubble", you do not have to input the comma
        (but it does not harm - it is removed automatically from your search expression).</p>
    <section>
        <h3>Proximity Search</h3>
        <p>A proximity search allows you to search for all of the words in the hits within the
            search scope, in the order they occur in, but within a certain proximity. You put the
            search engine in proximity search mode by enclosing the words in quotation marks and
            adding a tilde <code>~</code> after the rightmost quotation mark, immediately followed
            by the number of words you wish to allow between the two words. If you search for
                <code>"Fire bubble"~3</code> you will thus find "Fire burn, and cauldron bubble",
            but if you only allow two words to intervene, <code>"Fire bubble"~2</code>, you will
            not. More than two words are allowed: you can retrieve "I pray thee, stay with us: go
            not to Wittenberg" with <code>"pray stay Wittenberg"~6</code>.</p>
        <p>If you wish to search for words within a certain proximity, but regardless of the order
            they occur in, you have to use an OR expression: <code>"slumber beware"~5 OR "beware
                slumber"~5</code>. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Fuzzy Search</h3>
        <p>"Fuzzy Search" needs a little explanation. If you take a word, like "snake", you can make
            changes and additions to it. One change would thus give you "spake", "slave", "snare"
            and "snakes". If you make one more edits based on this, you can easily see that a lot of
            words can be generated. Since this search is very time-consuming, the maximum number of
            "edits" you can make is 2. To activate fuzzy search, you add a tilde <code>~</code>
            after the word in question, <code>snake~2</code>.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Wildcard Expressions</h3>
        <p>Wildcard Expressions allow you to mask individual characters or sequences of characters
            inside words. Say, to switch examples, you wish to find all occurrences of "test" and of
            "text". Now, you could search for <code>text test</code> (or <code>text OR test</code>), and this would give
            you what you wanted, but you can also use the wildcard <code>?</code> and search for <code>te?t</code>
            instead. This will find all words that consists of the two character "te", plus one
            character which can be anything, and end up with the character "t". It would also find
            "teat".</p>
        <p>In addition to <code>?</code> which requires one and one only character, you can also use <code>*</code> which
            stands for any character zero, one or more times. If you search for <code>te*t</code>, you are
            therefore likely to find many more words, among them "test" and "text", but also
            "tempest", "testament" and "tent"</p>
        <p>You do not have to signal in any way that you are performing a wildcard search: just
            including <code>?</code> or <code>*</code> is enough.</p>
        <p>A wildcard character cannot occur first in a search expression, so you cannot find
            "Hamlet" with <code>?amlet</code> or <code>*let</code>. If you wish to perform searches of this kind, you
            should use a regular expression.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Regular Expressions</h3>
        <p>Regular Expressions are also known as "regex" or "regexp". They are a very powerful tool
            for searching text (and for replacing text, but this is not relevant here). Lucene only
            supports a restricted range of regex operators, but they should be sufficient for most
            uses.</p>
        <p>You put the search engine into regex mode by enclosing your search term with slashes. So
            you would search e.g. for <code>/.{3}let/</code> to find "Hamlet" (but also, e.g. "fillet").</p>
        <section>
            <h4>Match any character</h4>
            <p>The period <code>.</code> can be used to represent any character (this is the same
                as the <code>?</code> wildcard).</p>
            <p> In order to retrieve the string "snake", the following expressions can
                be used:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>/s.ake/</code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>/.nak./</code>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h4>One-or-more</h4>
            <p>The plus sign <code>"+"</code> can be used to repeat the preceding shortest pattern
                once or more times. </p>
            <p>In order to retrieve the string "deer", the following expression can be
                used:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>/de+r/</code>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <section>
                <h4>Zero-or-more</h4>
                <p>The asterisk <code>*</code> can be used to match the preceding shortest pattern
                    zero-or-more times. Note that this applies to what comes before the asterisk -
                    the wildcard <code>*</code> stands for a character in itself (a wildcard <code>*</code> amounts to a
                    reg <code>.*</code>)</p>
                <p>In order to retrieve both the strings "weed" and "wed"
                    (and "welcomed" and "westward" and so on), the
                    following expression can be used:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>/we*d/</code>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h4>Zero-or-one</h4>
                <p>The question mark <code>?</code> makes the preceding shortest pattern optional.
                    It matches zero or one times. Note that in Lucene wildcard searches,
                        <code>?</code> stands for a character in itself; in regex searches the
                    question mark quantifies the immediately preceding character (or pattern). </p>
                <p>In order to retrieve the strings "weed" and "wed", the
                    following expression can be used:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>/wee?d/</code>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h4>Min-to-max</h4>
                <p>Curly brackets <code>{}</code> can be used to specify a minimum and
                    (optionally) a maximum number of times the preceding shortest pattern can
                    repeat. The allowed forms are:</p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td>{5}</td>
                        <td>repeat exactly 5 times</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>{2,5}</td>
                        <td>repeat at least twice and at most 5 times</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>{2,}</td>
                        <td>repeat at least twice</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <p>In order to retrieve the string "weed", the following expression can
                    be used:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>/we{2}d/</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>/we{2,}d/</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>/we{2,5}d/</code>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h4>Grouping</h4>
                <p>Parentheses <code>()</code> can be used to form sub-patterns. The quantity
                    operators listed above operate on the shortest previous pattern, which can be a
                    group.</p>
                <p>In order to retrieve the string "weed", the following expression can
                    be used:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>/w(..)+d/</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>/w(ee)*d/</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>/w(ee)?d/</code>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h4> Alternation </h4>
                <p>The pipe symbol <code>|</code> acts as an OR operator. The match will succeed if
                    the pattern on either the left-hand side or the right-hand side matches. This is
                    of course equivalent to the OR operator in standard Lucene syntax.</p>
                <p>In order to retrieve the strings "proportions" and
                        "preparations", the following expression can be used:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>/(prepara|propor)tions/</code>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h4>Character classes</h4>
                <p>Character classes are very important, since they allow you to mask variation with
                    more control than that offered by wildcards. You can thus use them to find words
                    even though they are written differently, e.g. have either "e" or "o" in a
                    certain position or have "a" and "e" in a certain position </p>
                <p>Ranges of potential characters may be represented as character classes by
                    enclosing them in square brackets <code>[]</code>. A leading caret <code>^</code>
                    negates the character class, that is, all characters other than the ones
                    following are signified.</p>
                <p> The allowed forms are:</p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td>[abc]</td>
                        <td>'a' or 'b' or 'c'</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>[a-c]</td>
                        <td>'a' to 'c'. i.e. 'a' or 'b' or 'c' </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>[-abc]</td>

                <p>The caret <code>^</code> negates the following characters.</p>
                <p>In order to retrieve the string "weed", the following expression
                    could be used:</p>
