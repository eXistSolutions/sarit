        <h3>Brief Search Help</h3>
        <section><!--<h4>Search 101</h4>-->
            <p>Some brief hints are given here — for fuller explanations, please consult the other
                search instructions.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Are you searching for all occurrences of a certain string? <ul>
                        <li>Search using the NGram Index.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Do you want to use Regular Expressions? <ul>
                        <li>With both NGram Index and Lucene Full-Text Index, use standard regex
                            syntax for ".", "?", "+" , "*", "[]" and "{}". </li>
                        <li>Enclose Regular Expressions in forward slashes ("/") when using the Lucene Full-Text Index. </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Do you want to search for the co-occurrence of a number of words? <ul>
                        <li>Check whether the texts are divided into words, and if they are, select
                            Use Lucene Full-Text Index and enter "AND" between the different words. </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>If you input a IAST search term or Devanagari search term, your search term will
                    by default be automatically converted to both
                    IAST and in Devanagari. If you wish to search using IAST or
                    Devanagari only, see below.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>What Does It Mean?</h4>
            <p>If you hover over the dropdowns in the Search panel, you will see their titles.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Search For What? <ul>
                        <li>You can either enter the precise term to search for or use Regular
                            Expressions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Search With Which Scripts? <ul>
                        <li>If you enter a search term in IAST and choose "Search with Devanagari
                            and IAST", your search term will be converted to Devanagari and your
                            search will include both your original (IAST) search term and the search
                            term converted into Devanagari.</li>
                        <li>If you enter a search term in IAST and choose "Search with Devanagari",
                            your search term will be converted to Devanagari and your search will
                            not be performed with the original (IAST) search term, only with the
                            search term converted into Devanagari.</li>
                        <li>If you enter a search term in IAST and choose "Search with IAST", the
                            search term will not be converted and your search will only be performed
                            with your original (IAST) search term.</li>
                        <li>This applies the other way 'round as well, so:</li>
                        <li>If you enter a search term in Devanagari and choose "Search with
                            Devanagari and IAST", your search term will be converted to IAST and
                            your search will include both your original (Devanagari) search term and
                            the search term converted into IAST.</li>
                        <li>If you enter a search term in Devanagari and choose "Search with IAST",
                            your search term will be converted to IAST and your search will not be
                            performed with the original (Devanagari) search term, only with the
                            search term converted into IAST.</li>
                        <li>If you enter a search term in Devanagari and choose "Search with
                            Devanagari", the search term will not be converted and your search will
                            only be performed with your original (Devanagari) search term.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Use Which Index? <ul>
                        <li>Select Use NGram Index if the texts you are searching are not segmented
                            into words or if you want to be sure that you find each and every
                            occurence of a string. In general, use this index with all texts in
                            Devanagari.</li>
                        <li>Select Use Lucene Full-Text Index only if the texts you are searching
                            are segmented into words. This applies to a few texts in romanisation,
                            mainly the Arthaśāstra. For information about the remaining texts, see
                                <a href="search-help-word-division.html">Word Division</a>. </li>
                        <li>Selecting Use Lucene Full-Text Index gives you extra search options, see
                                <a href="search-help-lucene.html">Lucene Search Help</a>. </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Search Which Document Part? <ul>
                        <li>You can choose to search the TEI Header or the TEI Text or both.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Search In Texts By Which Authors? <ul>
                        <li>You can choose Search In Texts By Any Author to search throughout the
                            corpus or you can select one or more authors to search in the texts
                            attributed to them.</li>
                        <li>Note that you can also select individual texts to search by clicking on
                            the check-boxes to the left of the titles.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Search Narrowly Or Broadly? <ul>
                        <li>This option is mainly relevant you are interested in finding the
                            co-occurrence of more than one search term within a certain part of the
                            text.</li>
                        <li>A narrow search searches for hits in smaller parts, whereas a broad
                            search searches for hits in larger parts. Two terms may occur together
                            in a larger part, but not in a smaller part.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Perform New Search or Continue Last Search? <ul>
                        <li>This gives you the option to refine your previous search, by restricting
                            or broadening the search result.</li>
                        <li>If you choose Perform New Search, your will search afresh, so your search will not relate to any
                            previous searches.</li>
                        <li>If you choose "AND Last Search", your search will restrict your last
                            search by requiring that the search criteria for both the last and the
                            present search are satisfied. You typically use this to search for the
                            co-occurence of two words. </li>
                        <li>If you choose "OR Last Search", your search will broaden your last
                            search by including both the results from the last and the present
                            search in the search results. You typically use this to search for
                            alternative forms of a word. </li>
                        <li>If you choose "NOT Last Search", your search will restrict your last
                            search by excluding the results from the present search. You typically use this to
                            remove specific hits from the search results. </li>
                        <li>Note that if you search using the Lucene Full-Text Index, you can
                            perform these operations in one search. If you search using the Ngram
                            Index, using this dropdown is the only way to use Boolean operators. </li>
                        <li>Note that all search hits are highlighted in page view when you search using
                            the Lucene Full-Text Index, but only one will be highlighted when you search using
                            the NGram Index.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
